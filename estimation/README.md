Estimating Distribution Parameters
===============

Overview
---------------

This program will be autograded.  That means that it's important to
not change function names and to not add additional functionality that
may improve the program but produce different results.  Make sure that
your unit tests pass.  This what a successful set of unit tests will
look like:

    $ python3 tests.py
    .....

    OK

District Margins (15 points)
----------------------------

In the US, our legislature is made up of representatives of individual
*districts* (unlike proportional representation systems).  Some of
these districts are competitive, meaning that the winner of the
election is not a "sure thing" based on the voters in the districts.
However, for a variety of reasons, many of these districts are not
very competitive.  

Words Presidents Use (15 points)
-------------------------------

Each year, the president of the United States is required to make a
speech to congress describing the "State of the Union".  We are going
to create a simple *bigram language model* with *add one (Laplace)*
smoothing.

Writeup (10 points)
-----------------------

Finally, include a brief plain-text file (not PDF, not Word, just a
plain ASCII text file) that:
* Describes whether Colorado's congression districts look more like the congressional districts of states that Obama won or that Romeny won
* Gives an example of a *word* that Obama said that no previous president said
* Gives an example of a *bigram* that Obama said that no previous president said
* Explains why you got the answer that you did for the party of Obama

Submitting Your Code
-----------------------

You'll need to submit your assignment (word_counts.py, districts.py,
and writeup.txt) on
[Moodle](https://moodle.cs.colorado.edu/course/view.php?id=49) as an
upload.
