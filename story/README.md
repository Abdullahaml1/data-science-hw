Telling a Story with Data (30 Points)
================

For this assignment, you need to find some data of your own.  After
you’ve found the data that you plan to use, post about it on Piazza
(also explain how you found it).  I want everybody to have different
data, so posting about it on Piazza will make it off limits to
everybody else (this is an incentive to get it done early).  The data
do not have to be publicly accessible (e.g. you can use personal /
professional data), but you should have every right to distribute and
discuss the data (don’t do anything sketchy to get the data).

Thoroughly describe the data using the analysis and visualization
techniques we covered in class (but feel free to go beyond them).  I
should come away with an understanding of your data.  A good dataset
will:

1.  Not be too small (If you can understand everything that’s going on
by looking at it, it’s a bad dataset).  I’ll stipulate that the
dataset must at least have 250 observations (but it can have much
more!).

2.  Be “real” - don’t make it up or use a purpose-built computer
program to generate it

3.  Explain what (if anything) you had to do to make the data usable.
This will likely be influenced by what visualizations analyses you
want to do with your data.

Submission 
===== 

Once you've created a story of your data, create a writeup with two
pages of text (but unlimited graphs) and submit to ELMS.
