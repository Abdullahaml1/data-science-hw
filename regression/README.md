Regression
===============

Overview
---------------



Predict the Republican Share (5 points)
----------------------------

It is possible to get more than the maximum number of points by doing
particularly well in your predictions.  You should do better than the
baseline predictions offered in the initial template (just using last
poll and state ID).

Construct a Model (20 points)
-------------------------------

You may use additional *data*.  We've provided a script to get data
from the HuffPo polling api.  You may not use the output of other
models as data.  If there's any doubt, ask on Piazza.  Your code
should run on the data that you upload in the form that you uploaded
it.  I.e., if you upload a zip file called foo.zip, your program
should create your predictions when placed in the same directory as foo.zip.

Writeup (15 points)
-----------------------


Submitting Your Code, Data, and Predictions
-----------------------

You'll need to submit your assignment (predict.py, data, pred.txt,
model.txt, writeup.txt) on Moodle as an upload.
