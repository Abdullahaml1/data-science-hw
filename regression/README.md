For this assignment, you'll be participating in the following Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Getting Started
=======================
To begin, you'll need to create code that loads in the data, fits a regression, and then outputs a submission in the correct CSV format.  Take a look at HW1 if you need a reminder of the format of how to do this or the "feature engineering" examples in class.

Grade
=======================
To get a good grade on this assignment, you'll need to explore:
* Different regression algorithms in sklearn
* Features for regression
* Create plots / error analysis to understand how your code is working
* Submit to Kaggle 

The process you explore will be reflected in your writeup, but your code must reproduce your output for your best submission.

Writeup
=======================
Your writeup should have:
* History of your Kaggle submissions
* A discussion of what you tried
* Plots to show your error analysis
* A discussion of what directions worked (and which didn't)
You are limited to 1000 words (but unlimited figures)

Upload
=======================
Upload all of your code and data (beyond the data from Kaggle) to ELMS.
